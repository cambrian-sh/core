"""Analyst agent (CognitiveAgent) — ADR-0023, migrated to SDK v2 (ADR-0036).

Reasons, compares, and evaluates using a structured chain-of-thought prompt. The
most general cognitive agent: handles inference, comparison, and evaluation when
neither code_generator nor summariser is a better fit.

Uses the default ``CognitiveAgent.run()`` → ``think()`` ReAct loop (memory +
@tool rounds) with class-level configuration.
