"""Research agent (CognitiveAgent) — ADR-0040 tool-using reference agent.

Combines web search, web extraction, and file read/write behind the ADR-0039
kernel-owned tool registry. Answers research questions by searching the web,
reading sources, and writing findings to files.

Uses the default ``CognitiveAgent.run()`` → ``think()`` ReAct loop.
