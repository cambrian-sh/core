"""Terminal agent (CognitiveAgent) — ADR-0040 tracer bullet.

Restores system command execution behind the ADR-0039 kernel-owned tool registry.
The agent receives the ``execute_command`` tool schema and marshals arguments in
its think() loop; calls route to the kernel via ``ExecuteTool`` and execute in a
capped, isolated child process. Approval is required (dangerous tool).

Uses the default ``CognitiveAgent.run()`` → ``think()`` ReAct loop with
class-level configuration.
